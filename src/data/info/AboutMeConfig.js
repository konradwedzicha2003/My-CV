As the time was passing by I wanted to know more and more about various things in programming and I still do even when things get hard and don\'t go so smoothly. Yet I know I am still inexperienced in many ways that\'s why I am not giving up and I am open to learn more things that can help me with getting better at this job, do things faster, easier and more correctly.',
